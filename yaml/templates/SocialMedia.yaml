      Fascism doesn’t march in with flags—it drips in with rhetoric.
      Trump’s “new America” isn’t new. It’s entropy wrapped in ego.
      Democracy doesn’t survive on autopilot. #RunFascistsRun

      The authoritarian playbook always starts the same way:
      - Rewrite the truth
      - Divide the base
      - Pretend chaos is leadership

      Trump’s “new America” is just the old entropy made louder.

      History repeats when people forget what it sounded like the first time.
      Rhetoric becomes rot when it erodes trust, truth, and intention.
      
      The “new America” some cheer for is actually a retreat into chaos.
