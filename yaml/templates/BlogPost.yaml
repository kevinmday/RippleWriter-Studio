lede: |
  Op-eds can be bold and honest when they show their receipts. Here’s why the current
  'strongman' wave is structurally self-defeating.

body: |
  [Your main argument in ~3–5 paragraphs. Keep paragraphs short. Tie each claim to an
  observable or cite below. Use your intention notes to steer emphasis.]

counterpoints_limits: |
  Smart readers expect you to steel-man the other side. Note valid concerns, boundary
  conditions, and unknowns.

conclusion: |
  Close the loop. Actionable takeaways and next read.
